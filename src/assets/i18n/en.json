Then comes CSS, which is a styling language that enhances what you have built with HTML, adding aesthetics to the webpage, such as colors, fonts, button styles, and much more‚ÄîCSS is a vast field. Additionally, JavaScript (JS) adds interactivity, making the page dynamic and functional. Together, these three languages form a complete system known as Front-End Development. If you master HTML, CSS, and JS, you can work as a Front-End Developer. However, to make your work easier, you should also learn frameworks like Bootstrap 5, which combines HTML, CSS, and JS in one place, making development faster and more efficient.",
